## Description
<p>Here Impelement ADAS system with specefic features that will be listed though readme file and make mobile application using MIT APP INVENTOR  with all needed operation required  </p>
<p>Features for this system:</p>
<p>1.Cruise control system : that used to fix current speed and release accelerate paddle </p>

<p>2.Brake Assist system : that used to avoid car crushing by keeping save distance with front car </p>

<p>3.Speed limit system : that used to make car catch max speed for The Road using  camera </p>

<p>4.Driving Monitoring system : that used to make sure that user is awake using camera  and using more sensors to monitor vital signs </p>

<p>there are serving operations like :</p>
<p>1.Memory Recall : as last configuration for car saved in memory like Kilo meter car moved value & last gear box state & last dashboard page and last speed limiter value stored</p>
<p>2.Bluetooth :that used to make MCU able to connect to mobile application </p>
<p>3.MIT app inventor :used to develop mobile application </p>
